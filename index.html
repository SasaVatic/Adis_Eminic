            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
              I started my career in broadcasting at the local Bay Area radio
              station, 96.1 FM. Upon entering the radio world I worked as an
              intern in the international programming department. With time, I
              inherited a lot of responsibilities and challenges becoming junior
              producer/writer of a nightly talk show. Eventually, I graduated to
              a programming director developing a very successful nightly
              “countdown” show. Our rich international community tuning in,
              allowed us to focus on global market introducing our listeners to
              new music via on air and live programming.
            <p>
              The show received governor’s awards for excellence in broadcasting
              three years in a row.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon my departure from the radio, I entered the publishing world
              working as a creative director for Crowned Ark Publishing. It
              focused on booking shows for various artists and performers,
              provided representation either solely or throughout our extended
              and very experienced affiliates, managed projects (including
              marketing campaigns), and published material for American and
              European markets. Additionally, I consulted various agencies to
              fight music pirating to build stability within the music industry
              in the Balkan region. I maintain a supporting relationship with
              EESA (Eastern European Service Agency) providing services that
              benefit the well-being of the local community. Besides their vast
              media involvement; they also focus on elderly care, child
              well-being, and mental health of which I am currently a
              contributor.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a songwriter I have published material for the United States
              and European markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Presently, I have a startup with an American based multi-platinum
              producer, Bryan Todd (Jordin Sparks, Miley Cyrus, Ashley Tisdale,
              Big Time Rush to name a few) at Universal Music Studios where I
              currently serve as a managing director.
